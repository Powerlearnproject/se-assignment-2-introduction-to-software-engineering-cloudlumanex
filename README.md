# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering is the disciplined application of engineering principles to the entire software development lifecycle. This encompasses activities from the initial conception and design of software systems to their implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance, and evolution.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Software engineering is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of software.

IT DIFFERS BY:
I. SCOPE- Software Engineering covers the entire software development cycle while Programming focuses on writing code to solve specific problem.
II. APPROACH- Software Engineering uses structured methodologies and systematic processes while Programming often involves an ad-hoc, informal approach.
III. Collaboration- Software Engineering involves multiple stakeholders and emphasizes teamwork while Programming can be a solitary activity with less emphasis on collaboration.
IV. DOCUMENTATION- Software Engineering requires extensive documentation while Programming often has minimal documentation.
V. QUALITY ASSURANCE- Software Engineering Emphasizes rigorous testing and QA processes while Programmming emphasizes on basic testing with less formal QA processes
VI. PROJECT MANAGEMENT- Software Engineering includes detailed project management practices while Programming typically lacks formal project management.
VII. RISK MANAGEMENT- Software Engineering actively manages risks throughout the project WHILE Programming handles risks in an ad-hoc manner.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering: 

Requirement engineering is an important phase in the software development lifecycle that focuses on defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements of a software system.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
