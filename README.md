Requirements Engineering
Requirements engineering is the process of systematically gathering, documenting, validating, and managing the needs and specifications of stakeholders for a software system. This process involves several stages: elicitation, analysis, specification, validation, and management. It is crucial in the software development lifecycle as it ensures that the final product meets user needs, reduces the risk of project failure, and provides a clear foundation for design and development.

Software Design Principles
Modularity: Break down the system into manageable, independent modules.
Abstraction: Simplify complex systems by focusing on essential features and hiding details.
Encapsulation: Restrict direct access to some components, protecting the integrity of the system's internal state.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Modularity in Software Design
Modularity is the design principle of breaking down a software system into distinct, self-contained modules that encapsulate specific functionalities. Each module can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. This improves maintainability by making it easier to isolate and fix defects, and enhances scalability by allowing modules to be added, removed, or updated with minimal impact on the overall system.

Testing in Software Engineering
Testing is the process of evaluating software to identify defects and ensure it meets the specified requirements. It includes various levels such as unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing. Effective testing improves software quality, reliability, and user satisfaction by detecting and resolving issues early in the development lifecycle.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

Levels of Software Testing
Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions for correctness.
Integration Testing: Ensures that combined components work together as expected.
System Testing: Verifies the complete integrated system against specified requirements.
Acceptance Testing: Validates the system's readiness for delivery by testing it against user needs and requirements.
Importance of Testing: Testing is crucial in software development to identify and fix defects early, ensure functionality meets requirements, improve quality and reliability, and enhance user satisfaction.

Version Control Systems
Version control systems manage changes to source code and other project files, allowing multiple developers to collaborate efficiently. They track revisions, enable branching and merging, and provide a history of changes for rollback and auditing.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
